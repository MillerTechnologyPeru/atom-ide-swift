# Swift IDE

This is the beginnings of an Atom IDE implementation for Swift.

It's very rough at the moment, and doesn't actually use much of the atom-ide-ui capabilities.


### Package Dependencies

- language-swiftt89
- tool-bar
- atom-swift-ui

### Credits

Original code by Sam Deane, Elegant Chaos.

Thanks to:

- the Swift and Atom teams, for so much awesome
- [@aciidbomb3r] for [swift-debugger](https://github.com/aciidb0mb3r/atom-swift-debugger), which got the ball rolling
